# callsigns
Find which country an amateur radio callsign belongs to by testing
a callsign for validity according to ITU allocations and format
specification (ITU Article 19.68, 19.69).

A match does not necessarily mean that the callsign is valid or even
available for assignment for amateur operators in that country, but
merely tests if allocation would be allowed under ITU rules.
